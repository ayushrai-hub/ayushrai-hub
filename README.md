## 🚀 Summary

AI Engineer with **2+ years of hands-on experience** building and improving **production LLM systems, AI agents, and RLHF pipelines**.  
I operate end-to-end — **problem → system design → implementation → deployment → iteration at scale**.

I’ve worked remotely with leading AI organizations via trusted vendors, contributed to **benchmarking & evaluation frameworks**, and helped improve **foundation model outputs and real-world user experience**.

I ship fast, think in systems, and optimize for **impact over noise**.

## 🧠 Core Expertise

- **LLMs & GenAI** — RAG, Agents, Tool Use, Prompt Systems, Evaluation
- **AI Agents** — multi-step reasoning, workflows, orchestration
- **RLHF & Alignment** — data quality, reward modeling, preference learning
- **AI Full-Stack** — APIs, backends, UX, automation, deployment
- **MVP & Product Engineering** — from idea → PRD → shipped product
- **Benchmarks & Evaluation** — quality, robustness, failure modes
- **Systems Thinking** — scale, security, latency, reliability

## 🏗️ What I Actually Do (End-to-End)

- Translate **business & user pain points** into technical solutions
- Design **AI system architectures** (agents, pipelines, services)
- Build **secure, scalable, production-ready AI systems**
- Lead teams, review PRs, set engineering standards
- Iterate fast using **modern AI-first workflows**
- Own systems from **development → deployment → maintenance**

I don’t just “use models” — I design **systems around them**.

## ⚡ Philosophy

I left traditional workflows early.  
I adapt fast, build responsibly, and focus on **real impact**.

I believe the future belongs to engineers who:
- understand **systems**
- think **architecturally**
- ship **secure, scalable products**
- and stay human while building powerful AI.
